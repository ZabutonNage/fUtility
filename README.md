# fUtility

fUtility is a collection of functional utilities for JavaScript.

At this stage it does not claim to be an actual library to be included in a project as you would usually expect. Although it might still work.

In the future fUtility might be restructured and become an npm module. But as there already are several FP libraries out there, there is no need to rush.

For the time being, fUtility will remain a collection of mostly self-contained tools that can easily be cherry picked.

Breaking changes are to be expected.
